This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP: the silent failure when attempting to access array elements using an index that is out of bounds. The provided code includes a function that is intended to increment the value of an array element at a given index. However, if the provided index is out of bounds, the function silently does nothing, without issuing any warnings or errors. This behavior can be problematic as it may lead to unexpected results or logic errors that are difficult to track down.  The solution file offers a revised function that handles out-of-bounds indices more gracefully.
